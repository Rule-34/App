## Future

### API

This app uses a JSON wrapper for various Rule 34 APIs, it is developed and mantained by me, and can be found [here](https://github.com/VoidlessSeven7/Rule-34-API).

### Support

Since the API is being hosted on heroku's free tier, It wont hold lots of connections at the same time, specially when serving videos from Rule 34 APIs, So I've planned and developed a solution:

If the API is duplicated and a load balancer is placed between them, the requests would be distributed efficiently removing pressure from the APIs, keeping everything running smoothly, but the idea has its caveats

**Funding**, I am not on a wealthy position to maintain everything from my pocket, as I'm already paying for the domain name, hosting, etc.

Since this is a **free** project that I have created, with **no ads** to generate revenue, I ask of you, **if you really like my work**, please donate whatever amount you can to the future of this app.
