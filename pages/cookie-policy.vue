        We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in

        cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online

        You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting
        your preferences in the Consent Preferences Center. The Consent Preferences Center allows you to select which

        Cookies are not the only way&nbsp;to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar
        technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are
        tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our
        Website or opened an email including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor&nbsp;the traffic patterns of
        users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether
        you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
        performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are
        reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
