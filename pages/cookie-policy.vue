        <strong> What are cookies? </strong>
      </div>
      <div>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies
        are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as
        to provide reporting information.
      </div>
      <div>
        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Rule 34 App) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by
        parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party
        features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content). The
        parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in
        question and also when it visits certain other websites.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong> Why do we use cookies? </strong>
      </div>
      <div>
        We use first party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our
        Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also

        Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising, and other purposes. This is described in more
        detail below.

        <strong> What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons? </strong>
      </div>
      <div>
        Cookies are not the only way&nbsp;to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar
        technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are
        tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our
        Website or opened an email including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor&nbsp;the traffic patterns of
        users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether
        you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
        performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are
        reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

        <strong> Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects? </strong>
      </div>
      <div>
        Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other
        things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for other site
        operations.
      </div>
      <div>
        If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to
        block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the&nbsp;
        <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">
          Website Storage Settings Panel
        </a>
        . You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the&nbsp;
        <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">
          Global Storage Settings Panel
        </a>
        &nbsp;and&nbsp;following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to
        delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from
        being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash
        Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
      </div>
      <div>
        Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede
        the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with
        our services or online content.
