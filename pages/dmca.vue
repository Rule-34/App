        The Rule 34 App (https://r34.app) is a search engine that indexes and links to content hosted on third-party
        websites. We do not host any content ourselves. If you believe that your copyrighted work has been infringed
        upon by a website that we link to, please follow these steps:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Identify the Website Hosting the Content</strong>: Locate the specific website that is hosting the
          allegedly infringing content, its usually indicated on the top of the page, or at the URL.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact the Website Owner</strong>: As we do not host the content, you will need to contact the owner
          or administrator of the website hosting the content to request its removal. Most websites have a DMCA or
          copyright infringement process outlined on their site.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Please note that the Rule 34 App cannot process DMCA notices or remove content from third-party websites. We are
        merely a search engine that indexes and links to content hosted elsewhere on the internet. If you have any
        further questions or concerns, please contact us at contact@r34.app.
