        The Rule 34 App (https://r34.app) is a search engine that indexes and links to content hosted on third-party
        websites. We do not host any content ourselves. If you believe that your copyrighted work has been infringed
        upon by a website that we link to, please follow these steps:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Identify the Website Hosting the Content</strong>: Locate the specific website that is hosting the
          allegedly infringing content. The Rule 34 App does not host any content directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact the Website Owner</strong>: As we do not host the content, you will need to contact the owner
          or administrator of the website hosting the content to request its removal. Most websites have a DMCA or
          copyright infringement process outlined on their site.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provide Proper Notice</strong>: When contacting the website owner, provide a proper DMCA notice that
          includes the following information:
          <ul>
            <li>Your contact information (name, address, email, phone number)</li>
            <li>Identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim have been infringed</li>
            <li>The specific URL(s) where the infringing content is located</li>
            <li>
              A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material is not authorized by the
              copyright owner, its agent, or the law
            </li>
            <li>
              A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you
              are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Follow Up with the Website Owner</strong>: If the website owner fails to respond or remove the
          infringing content, you may need to pursue further legal action directly against them.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Please note that the Rule 34 App cannot process DMCA notices or remove content from third-party websites. We are
        merely a search engine that indexes and links to content hosted elsewhere on the internet. If you have any
        further questions or concerns, please contact us at contact@r34.app.
