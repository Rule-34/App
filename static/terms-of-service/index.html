    <h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
    <p>
      The intellectual property in the materials contained in this website are
      owned by or licensed to Rule 34 App and are protected by applicable
      copyright and trademark law. We grant our users permission to download one
      copy of the materials for personal, non-commercial transitory use.
    </p>
    <p>
      This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title. This
      license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these
      restrictions or the Terms of Service, and may be terminated by Rule 34 App
      at any time.
    </p>

    <h3>Liability</h3>
    <p>
      Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an 'as is'
      basis. To the extent permitted by law, Rule 34 App makes no warranties,
      expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other
      warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions
      of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement
      of intellectual property, or other violation of rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no event shall Rule 34 App or its suppliers be liable for any
      consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party arising
      from the use or inability to use this website or the materials on this
      website, even if Rule 34 App or an authorized representative has been
      notified, orally or in writing, of the possibility of such damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the context of this agreement, &ldquo;consequential loss&rdquo;
      includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss
      of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of
      goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss
      of use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether under statute, contract,
      equity, tort (including negligence), indemnity, or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties,
      or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these
      limitations may not apply to you.

    <p>
      The license key given to you via the subscription is absolutely personal

      gather personal information, so it must be kept secret.

      you to maliciously use or share your license key.
    </p>
