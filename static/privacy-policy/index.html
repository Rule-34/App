    <h1>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>

      This Privacy Policy applies to
      <a href="https://r34.app">https://r34.app</a>, its subdomains and the apps

    </p>

    <p>
      It is Rule 34 App's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
      information we may collect while operating our website.

      <br />

      identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have
      adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information
      may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under
      what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This
      Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website
      and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.

    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>

    <p>
      Like most website operators, Rule 34 App collects
      non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
      servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
      preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
      Rule 34 App's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
      is to better understand how Rule 34 App's visitors use its website. From
      time to time, Rule 34 App may release non-personally-identifying
      information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
      the usage of its website.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rule 34 App also collects potentially personally-identifying information
      like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, terms searched or changed settings
      throught the website. Rule 34 App only discloses this information under
      the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
      information as described below.
    </p>

    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

    <p>
      Certain visitors to Rule 34 App's websites choose to interact with Rule 34
      App in ways that require Rule 34 App to gather personally-identifying
      information. The amount and type of information that Rule 34 App gathers
      depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
      sign up for an account at https://r34.app to provide a username and email
      address.
    </p>

    <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

    <p>
      Rule 34 App may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
      website. Rule 34 App may display this information publicly or provide it
      to others. However, Rule 34 App does not disclose your
      personally-identifying information.

      contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
      information in order to process it on Rule 34 App's behalf or to provide
      services available at Rule 34 App's website, and (ii) that have agreed not

      our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep
      this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via
      a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the
      right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request
      or to help us support other users. Rule 34 App takes all measures
      reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
      alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
